Output:
	create  /link

	# kqueue sends an event because it sends an event every time a directory
	# changes, but fsnotify doesn't detect the symlink as a "directory". It's
	# been like this for over a decade. When it was changed before people
	# complained so I'm hesitant to fix it now as part of a bugfix.

	# TODO: it shouldn't do this; it doesn't work like this on inotify.
