  # TODO: should probably add this, but on my local machine the tests time out
  #       with -race as the waits aren't long enough (OpenBSD is kind of slow),
  #       so should probably look into that first. Go 1.19 is supposed to have a
  #       much faster race detector, so maybe waiting until we have that is
